How to get cpan2rpm to work under RedHat 6.x:

There are a number of quirks to be aware of when using
cpan2rpm under RedHat 6.0, 6.1, or 6.2 because of the
older perl 5.00503 and older ExtUtils::MakeMaker and
older rpm 3.0.x that comes with it.  If it is feasible
to upgrade to a more recent RedHat version, I recommend
to do so.  If it is too inconvenient to upgrade right
now, but you wish to still use cpan2rpm, then follow
the instructions below.

Issue #1: LWP is quite painful to install.

LWP is quite painful to install.  I don't recommend even
attempting to install it (if you haven't already) at least
until you get cpan2rpm up and running.  Download tarball
and extract manually.

$ lynx http://[url]/cpan2rpm-xxx.tar.gz
$ gtar -zxvf cpan2rpm-*.tar.gz
$ ./cpan2rpm --mk ~/redhat

Issue #2: sudo

I haven't been able to find a real sudo utility that
works under the old redhat distro.  So here's a hack:

$ mkdir ~/bin
$ echo -e '#!/usr/bin/perl\nexec "su","-c","@ARGV";' > ~/bin/sudo
$ chmod 0755 ~/bin/sudo

This isn't as good as the real sudo because you have
to type the root password instead of your user password.
But the worst part is that you have to keep typing it,
whereas the real sudo will cache the password for a
while after the first successful attempt.  Let me know
if you think of a better way.

Issue #3: RPM 3.0.x

The old rpm does not have two required macros.

$ echo %__perl /usr/bin/perl >> ~/.rpmmacros
$ echo %makeinstall make install >> ~/.rpmmacros

The rpms posted on the arix site are not compatible
with the old rpm.  You'll need to build it manually.
There is no rpmbuild command on the older versions.
Just use the rpm command instead.

$ gtar -zxvf cpan2rpm-*.tar.gz
$ cd cpan2rpm-*
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
$ make dist
$ rpm -ta cpan2rpm-*.tar.gz
$ sudo rpm -Uvh ~/redhat/RPMS/noarch/cpan2rpm-*.rpm
Password: <root_password_instead_of_user_password>

Issue #4: Perl 5.005

For security reasons, it is good to use File::Temp
instead of passing --tempdir= all the time.
Unfortunately, the old version of File::Spec that
comes with the old perl is not good enough for
File::Temp so you'll need to upgrade that first.

$ rm -rf /tmp/cpan2rpm
$ cpan2rpm --tempdir /tmp/cpan2rpm --install --shadow-pure File::Spec
$ rm -rf /tmp/cpan2rpm
$ cpan2rpm --tempdir /tmp/cpan2rpm --install File::Temp
$ rm -rf /tmp/cpan2rpm

Issue #5: MakeMaker

To upgrade MakeMaker requires a few dependancies first.
It is probably not necessary nor worth the trouble.
It is recommened to skip this section,  but if you
really want to try the new MakeMaker on the old perl,
then here is how:

# For Pod::Parser
$ cpan2rpm --install PodParser

# For Term::ANSIColor
$ cpan2rpm --install ANSIColor

# For Pod::Man
$ cpan2rpm --shadow-pure podlators
$ sudo rpm -ql -p ~/redhat/RPMS/i386/perl-podlators-1.25-1.i386.rpm " | xargs -i echo '[ -e {} ] && echo cp --verbose --preserve {} {}.rpmsave' | sh | sh"
$ sudo rpm --replacefiles -Uvh ~/redhat/RPMS/i386/perl-podlators-1.25-1.i386.rpm

# Test::Harness has a weird author?
$ cpan2rpm --install --shadow-pure Test::Harness

# And finally ExtUtils::MakeMaker
# Not sure why that one regex test keeps failing.
$ cpan2rpm --install --make-no-test --shadow-pure ExtUtils::MakeMaker

Issue #6: HTTP::Lite

It is nice to have a perl module to download the remote URLs on the fly.

cpan2rpm --install HTTP::Lite

It is left as an excercise to the reader to install LWP (bloat).

Good luck!
